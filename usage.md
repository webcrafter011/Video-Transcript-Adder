# Video Processing Project

This project is designed to process videos by downloading, encoding, concatenating, adding text overlays, and mixing background audio. It uses Node.js and FFmpeg for video processing.

## Project Structure

The project directory contains the following files and folders:

- **`node_modules/`**: Contains all the npm packages installed for the project.
- **`temp/`**: Temporary directory used for storing intermediate files during video processing. Only the final output video is retained after processing.
- **`output.mp4`**: The final processed video file.
- **`index.js`**: The main entry point of the application.
- **`main.js`**: Contains the core logic for video processing.
- **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that locks the versions of installed npm packages.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- **`working.js`**: A working script or utility file (if applicable).

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **FFmpeg**: Install FFmpeg on your system. You can download it from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/project
   ```
3. Install the required npm packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure all required input files (e.g., video URLs, audio links, transcription details) are configured in the script.
2. Run the project:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```
3. The final processed video will be saved in the `temp/` directory as `final_output.mp4`.

## Configuration

- **Video URLs**: Provide the URLs of the videos to be processed in the `videoDetails` array.
- **Audio Link**: Provide the URL of the background audio in the `audioLink` variable.
- **Transcription Details**: Provide the text and timestamps for the text overlays in the `transcriptionDetails` array.

## Cleaning Up

After processing, the `temp/` directory will contain only the final output video (`final_output.mp4`). All intermediate files are automatically deleted.

## Dependencies

- **axios**: For downloading files from URLs.
- **fluent-ffmpeg**: For video processing using FFmpeg.
- **ffmpeg-static**: Provides a static FFmpeg binary for the project.
